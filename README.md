Messing with Occulus DK2 and Open Frameworks on Ubuntu 15.04
## Current Issues

I can not get more than one eye to reder at once, as shown below. I got this after adding "#define SDK_RENDERER 1" to the top of testApp.h (If I don't have that, the applicaion will only display a black screen) 

I am using the ofxDK2 add-on for linux, [https://github.com/sphaero/ofxOculusDK2/tree/linux_0.4.4](https://github.com/sphaero/ofxOculusDK2/tree/linux_0.4.4)
